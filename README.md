OCCS Project #1 Repository

<h1>Project #1</h1>
For project #1 I have selected "Twitter".
Date: 2/25/2016, I have done the following:
- Created three mockups with each mockup related to a single, individual story.
- Created a new repository on GIT entitled "OCCS-Project-1".
- Created three "issues" one for each story and uploaded a screenshot of the mockup related to each story.
